# Variables

Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. Python variable is also known as an identifier and used to hold value.

In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language and smart enough to get variable type.

```
// Example code
number = 5
name = "John"
print(number)
print(name)
```
