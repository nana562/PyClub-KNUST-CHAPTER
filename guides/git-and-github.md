# Git and Github

## An Intro to Git and GitHub

### What is Git?

**Git** is an **open-source distributed version control system**. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

Git is foundation of many services like **GitHub** and **GitLab**, but we can use Git without using any other Git services. Git can be used **privately** and **publicly**

{% hint style="info" %}
Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in **2005** to develop Linux Kernel. It is also used as an important distributed version-control tool for **the DevOps**.

Git is not a programming language, so you should have a basic understanding of Windows and Linux commands only.

### Benefits of Git

A version control application allows us to **keep track** of all the changes that we make in the files of our project. Every time we make changes in files of an existing project, we can push those changes to a repository. Other developers are allowed to pull your changes from the repository and continue to work with the updates that you added to the project files.

Some **significant benefits** of using Git are as follows:

* **Saves Time**\
  Git is lightning fast technology. Each command takes only a few seconds to execute so we can save a lot of time as compared to login to a GitHub account and find out its features.
* **Offline Working**\
  One of the most important benefits of Git is that it supports **offline working**. If we are facing internet connectivity issues, it will not affect our work. In Git, we can do almost everything locally. Comparatively, other CVS like SVN is limited and prefer the connection with the central repository.
* **Undo Mistakes**\
  One additional benefit of Git is we can **Undo** mistakes. Sometimes the undo can be a savior option for us. Git provides the undo option for almost everything.
* **Track the Changes**\
  Git facilitates with some exciting features such as **Diff, Log,** and **Status**, which allows us to track changes so we can **check the status, compare** our files or branches.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

In this quickstart guide, you will:

* Create and use a repository
* Start and manage a new branch
* Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
* Open and merge a pull request

You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on).
